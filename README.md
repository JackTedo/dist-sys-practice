## Docker Container
### Beginner Level: Docker Container
#### [Video: Why Docker?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDHUTHLf8U&t=0s&list=PLBmVKD7o3L8tQzt8QPCINK9wXmKecTHlM&index=23)  
Time: 15 min   

1. Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run. 
2. Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers on EC2 instances in your clusters.

#### [Lab: DevOps Docker Beginners Guide](https://training.play-with-docker.com/ops-s1-hello/)  
Time: 1 hr  

1. Running your first container  
	Firstly, log into a docker sandbox environment. Type: "docker container run hello-world" to run the fist container. Container is different to VM in that A container is an application abstraction;  
  
2. Docker Image
	The pull command fetches the alpine image from the Docker registry and saves it in our system.

3. Containers and images are different concept.  
	__Images__: The file system and configuration(read-only) of application which are used to create containers.   
	__Containers__: Containers are running instances of Docker images. Containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS.  
  
4. Container Isolation  
	Even though two containers share the same image, these two instances are separated from each other. No matter what happens in an instance, it won't affect other instances. 
	This is a critical security concept in the world of Docker containers! Even though each docker container run command used the same alpine image, each execution was a separate, isolated container. Each container has a separate filesystem and runs in a different namespace; by default a container has no way of interacting with other containers, even those from the same image.
	
## Cloud Web Apps
### Beginner Level: Cloud Web Apps
#### [AWS Tutorial: Launch a VM](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/)  
Time: 30 min   
1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the Amazon Web Service you use to create and run virtual machines in the cloud. AWS calls these virtual machines 'instances'.
2. Steps
	   
	
	Step 1: Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance
	
	Login in and open the Amazon EC2 console, then click Launch Instance to create and configure your virtual machine.
	
	Step 2: Configure your Instance
	
	Important: After you download the MyKeyPair key, you will want to store your key in a secure location. If you lose your key, you won't be able to access your instance. If someone else gets access to your key, they will be able to access your instance. This key will be used in future.
	
	Step 3: Connect to your Instance
	
	Step 4: Terminate Your Instance
	
	You can easily terminate the instance from the EC2 console. In fact, it is a best practice to terminate instances you are no longer using so you donâ€™t keep getting charged for them.
	
	Important: I once forgot to terminate the instance and found out later that my account instance usage added up many hours.
	
	
	Summary: This is the basic usage of EC2, not difficulty.

	
#### [QwikLab: Intro to S3](https://awseducate.qwiklabs.com/focuses/30?parent=catalog)  
Time: 1 hr 

 Amazon S3 is a cloud computing web service offered by Amazon Web Services. Amazon S3 provides object storage through web services interfaces. 
 
1. Create a Bucket  
	Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket  
  
2. Upload an Object to the Bucket
	An object can be any kind of file: a text file, a photo, a video, a zip file, etc. Add an object to Amazon S3 to let it available in network with permission

3. Make Your Object Public
  
	Configure permissions on your object so that it is publicly accessible. The object is private by default.
	
4. Create a Bucket Policy

	Bucket Policy is a set of permissions associated with an Amazon S3 bucket. It can be used to control access to a whole bucket or to specific directories within a bucket.

5. Explore Versioning
	Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.
